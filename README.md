## A Simple simulator for SCT based swarm control: 
- Each thread is representing an individual in the swarm
- The swarm only does one thing, when an object is detected, turn left
- You simulate objects by typing “y” when prompted
- This event is then processed by the swarm, and you can watch in real time as the individuals “turn left” in unison

### Notes:
- A single monolithic supervisor is being used because the behavior is so simple.
